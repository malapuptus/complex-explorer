This is the canonical record of out-of-scope edits made during ticket execution.

| Ticket | Out-of-scope file(s)                                                 | Why                                                                                                                                                                                       | How to avoid next time                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0134   | `src/domain/reflection.ts`                                           | New `"timeout"` flag required a reflection template entry to keep the build green. The file was not in the allowed-edits list.                                                            | Split into two tickets: one for the flag addition (scoring layer) and one for the reflection template update. Alternatively, widen allowed edits upfront when adding new `FlagKind` values. |
| 0136   | `src/app/DemoSession.tsx`                                            | CSV export needed `csvMeta` prop threading from the session host component.                                                                                                               | Include host/integration components in allowed edits when changing child component interfaces.                                                                                              |
| 0145   | `src/domain/index.ts`, `src/infra/__tests__/draftLock.test.ts` (new) | New `DraftLock` type and `DRAFT_LOCK_TTL_MS` constant needed re-exporting from the domain barrel; lock tests required a new test file under infra.                                        | Expand allowed edits to include barrel re-export files and test directories when adding new domain types.                                                                                   |
| 0146   | `src/domain/fingerprint.ts` (new), `src/app/DemoSession.tsx`         | New fingerprint module needed a dedicated file; `DemoSession` required edits to compute and thread the fingerprint on completion.                                                         | Include host/orchestration components and allow new domain files when the ticket introduces a new domain concept.                                                                           |
| 0149   | `src/app/DemoSession.tsx`                                            | Reproducibility bundle in `ResultsView` required passing `orderPolicy`, `trialTimeoutMs`, and `breakEveryN` via `csvMeta`, which meant editing the parent component.                      | Include host/integration components in allowed edits when expanding a child component's props interface.                                                                                    |
| 0172   | `vite.config.ts`                                                     | Needed a compile-time `__APP_VERSION__` define so Research Bundle `appVersion` is populated without runtime I/O or bundling `package.json`. This file was outside the allowed-edits list. | Include `vite.config.ts` (or a dedicated build/version module) in allowed edits whenever introducing build-time constants, version stamping, or bundle metadata.                            |
| 0194   | `src/app/DemoSession.tsx`, `src/app/DemoSessionHelpers.ts`, `src/infra/index.ts` | Custom pack import requires the session host to resolve packs from the custom store, helpers to build pack options from custom entries, and the infra barrel to export the new store. | Include host/orchestration components, barrel files, and helper modules in allowed edits when adding a new data source or storage adapter. |
